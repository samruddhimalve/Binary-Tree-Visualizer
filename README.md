# 🌌 Tree Visualizer - A Stunning Interactive Binary Tree Representation

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is an interactive **Binary Search Tree (BST) visualizer** that allows users to input values (numbers, operators, or characters) to generate a tree dynamically. Users can view different traversal orders (**Preorder, Inorder, and Postorder**) by clicking the respective buttons. The UI is enhanced with **galaxy-themed animations**, hover effects, and smooth transitions to provide a mind-blowing experience. 🚀✨
